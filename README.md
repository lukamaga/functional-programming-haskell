# Functional Programming in Haskell

This repository contains laboratory assignments for the university course "Funkcinis Programavimas" (Functional Programming). The work demonstrates implementation of various algorithms and data structures using the Haskell programming language.

## Overview of Concepts
- Fundamental paradigms: Pattern matching, guards, and recursion.
- Higher-order functions: Map, filter, and folding operations (foldr, foldl).
- Algebraic Data Types (ADT): Custom implementations of General Trees, Expressions, and Geometric shapes.
- Advanced topics: Implementation of Regular Expression engines, Infinite Data Streams, and mathematical conjectures.

## Project Structure
- Lab 1: Basic Haskell syntax, recursion, and quadratic equation solvers.
- Lab 2: List comprehensions, prime number algorithms, and string processing.
- Lab 3: Logical operations on geometric shapes, function composition, and custom unzip/length implementations.
- Lab 4: General tree traversal, infinite streams, and generalized expression evaluators.

## Usage
The assignments are structured as Haskell modules. To run or test the functions, use the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC).

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the specific lab directory.
3. Open the file in the GHC interpreter:
   ghci <filename>.hs
